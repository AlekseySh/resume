Catalyst is a popular \textbf{open-source} analogue of Keras for PyTorch (3k stars on GitHub, part of PyTorch ecosystem).
Among other things, I have implemented and tested a metric learning module for obtaining the representations of objects.

This project is a continuation of the metric learning pipeline which I've implemented in Catalyst.
Note, that the project is under the construction now and I am going to release it soon.

{2nd place (out of 100+ teams)}
{11 Oct 2019 -- 10 Feb 2020}{}
This was a tabular competition with the following task: \textit{"Predict when and where road incidents will occur next in Cape Town"}. We achieved good results due to non-standard feature engineering for spatial data and a neat validation pipeline.
