\cvsection{Work experience}

\cvevent{Staff Data Scientist}
{\href{https://www.newyorker.de/}{NewYorker GmbH}}{March 2021 -- present}{Berlin, Germany}
I led a team that works on vector representation for the \textbf{images} of the company's product catalog.
I was responsible for research and development and also
communicated with other teams and stakeholders to find the best way of using our model.
Finally, we came up with exposing it as an internal API. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Our colleagues boosted metrics in their data science projects via using our API. 
\item We also released the training pipeline as open-source \href{https://github.com/OML-Team/open-metric-learning}{\underline{library}} to improve our employer branding. 
\end{itemize}

\cvevent{Applied Data Scientist}{Neuromation Inc.}{March 2018 -- October 2020}{}
Working in a start-up allowed me to broaden my horizons and realize projects in machine learning consulting, for example:
\begin{itemize}
\item Built a \textbf{computer vision} system which was able to save doctors' time by checking if a box with surgical tools was correctly completed. The challenge was to solve the problem without retraining the model for the new tools (in a few-shot way).
\item Created a \textbf{text} processing tool to help operators extract useful information from emails. It required fulfilling the project from communicating with a client and setting up the data labelling process to containerization and deploying the trained model.
\end{itemize}

\cvevent{Junior Data Analyst}{3Red Trading, LLC}{June 2016 -- March 2017}{}
The company analyzed billions of transactions from the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange}
{Chicago Mercantile Exchange}.
Based on statistical anomalies, I recognized traders who used automatic tools, which allowed our team to predict their behavior.
