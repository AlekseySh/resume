\cvevent{Machine learning engineer}{Neuromation Inc.}{March 2018 -- October 2020}{Saint-Petersburg, Russia}
Working in a start-up allowed me to broaden my horizons and realize projects in machine learning consulting, for example:
\begin{itemize}
\item Built a \textbf{computer vision} system which was able to save doctors' time by checking if a box with surgical tools was correctly completed. This was a challenge because there were a lot of diverse tools and we had to solve the problem without retraining the model for the new ones (in a few-shot way), \href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FBNRTkxkGzzfVHlrwJCauK7xjBWkI7xO/view?usp=sharing}{\underline{link}}.
\item Created a \textbf{text} processing tool to extract useful information from emails. It required to fulfill a project from communicating with the client and setting up the data labeling process to containerization and deploying the trained model.
\end{itemize}
