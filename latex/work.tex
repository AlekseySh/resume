\cvevent{Staff Data Scientist}
{\href{https://www.newyorker.de/}{NewYorker GmbH}}{March 2021 -- present}{Berlin, Germany}
I led a team that works on vector representation for the \textbf{images} of the company's product catalog.
I was responsible for research and development and also
communicated with other teams and stakeholders to find the best way of using our model.
Finally, I came up with exposing it as an internal API. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Thanks to this API our colleagues from other DS projects boosted their metrics. 
\item I also released the training pipeline as an open-source \href{https://github.com/OML-Team/open-metric-learning}{\underline{library}} and promoted
it on 
\href{https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uHmLU8vMrMVMFodt36u0uXAgYjG_3D30?usp=share_link}{\underline{meetups}}
to improve our employer branding. 
\end{itemize}

\cvevent{Applied Data Scientist}{Neuromation Inc.}{March 2018 -- October 2020}{}
Working in a start-up allowed me to broaden my horizons and realize projects in machine learning consulting, for example:
\begin{itemize}
\item Built a \textbf{computer vision} system which was able to save doctors' time by checking if a box with surgical tools was correctly completed. The challenge was to solve the problem without retraining the model for the new tools (in a few-shot way).
\item Created a \textbf{text} processing tool to help operators extract useful information from emails. It required fulfilling the project from communicating with a client and setting up the data labelling process to containerization and deploying the trained model.
\end{itemize}

\cvevent{Junior Data Analyst}{3Red Trading, LLC}{June 2016 -- March 2017}{}
The company analyzed billions of transactions from the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange}
{Chicago Mercantile Exchange}.
Based on statistical anomalies, I recognized traders who used automatic tools, which allowed our team to predict their behavior.
